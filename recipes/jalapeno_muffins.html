        <li>  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease the cups of a 12-muffin tin.</li>
        <li>Place 1/4 cup butter in a small skillet and melt. When butter is melted, add onion and minced jalape単o and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine beaten eggs and buttermilk, stirring briskly to combine.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, taco seasoning, salt, and baking soda.
        </li>
        <li>When the onions and jalape単os have cooled to room temperature, combine with egg and buttermilk mixture, stirring briskly.
        </li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients, stirring until dry ingredients are just moistened and there are no lumps. Pour batter evenly into prepared muffin cups. Place a slice of jalape単o on top of each muffin.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. If it does not come out clean, bake about 5 minutes more and test again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool in the pan on a rack, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.
            </li>
    </ol>
